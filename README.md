# Background
SambaSonic, an emerging company, is strategically expanding to enhance market share by
efficiently meeting the rising demand for Cavaquinho during the vibrant Brazilian Carnival
seasons. Recognizing the instrument's cultural significance, SambaSonic aims to capitalize on
the festival's buzz. We have taken into account the construction of new factories, implementing
a new transit hub, addressing potential penalties, and working within a specified budget in order
to achieve this.

# Problem Statement
Upper management aims to fulfill potential demand of Cavaquinho in retail over the Carnival
season to harness the festivity as a means to build brand awareness. The company places
significant value on meeting customer demand, with a penalty cost of $800 per unit for every
missed opportunity. To accommodate the expected surge in demand during the Carnival
season, SambaSonic is contemplating the construction of new factories in Patos de Minas (PF)
and/or Uberaba (PF2), each incurring a $9 million investment. Additionally, the consideration of
a new transit hub in Campo Belo (PTH), costing $3 million, is on the table to ensure
On-Time-In-Full (OTIF) product delivery. Despite ambitious growth plans, the expansion strategy
is constrained by a budget limitation of $13 million, requiring careful allocation of resources to
maximize impact.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to meet demand requirements fully at the most optimum
total costs associated with production, shipment, and demand penalties. Additionally, the project
aims to strategically incorporate new investments while complying with the specified budget
constraints.

# Business Case
Data Collection - This project utilizes data from International Journal of Production Economics -
Optimization in inventory-routing problem with planned transshipment: A case study in the retail
industry in combination with data retrieved from independent research.
Model Selection - The model solution adopts the Transshipment approach in combination with
Linear Programming (LP) models. LP models are well-suited for problems where the
relationships are linear. The flexibility of LP models is crucial for addressing complex
transshipment problems with diverse cost considerations, capacity constraints, and other
factors.

# Key Findings
Before implementing the proposed factories and the additional transit hub, the optimisation
software Gurobi identified a supply shortage in the logistics network, with 215 units not met,
incurring a substantial opportunity cost of $172,000. Notably, SÃ£o Paulo (R5) faced a shortage
of 120 units, costing $96,000, and Vila Velha (R6) lacked 95 units, incurring a $76,000
opportunity cost. The total cost was $491,746.82.
After establishing Patos de Minas (PF) and Campo Belo (PTH) resolved the shortage. Factories
now send 662 units, meeting the demands. Campo Belo (PTH) handles the additional volume.
The total cost reduced to $473,425.42, eliminating opportunity costs and ensuring fulfillment
across all retailers.

# Conclusion
SambaSonic's supply chain analysis focused on enhancing efficiency through new factories and
transit hubs. The existing model revealed significant shortcomings in meeting retailer demands,
leading to a substantial opportunity cost of $491,746.82. The updated model strategically
establishes a factory in Patos de Minas (PF) and a transit hub in Campo Belo (PTH), effectively
addressing unfulfilled demand and minimizing costs. The expanded production and optimized
transit hub eliminate the supply shortage, resulting in the elimination of opportunity costs and a
significant overall cost reduction. In conclusion, the updated shipping network proves
operationally efficient and aligns with SambaSonic's growth objectives within budget constraints.
